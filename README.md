# BabyNameEntry
A small app that lets couples keep track of baby names they like, and shows a list of any matches.

The base functionality is complete, but I am looking to add new features.

There is essentially no styling done, so if anybody is looking to get some front end practice in, feel free to
design/style the page and submit a pull request.
